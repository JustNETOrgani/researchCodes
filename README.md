# Research Codes
A repository containing a modified JavaScript implementation of Lightweight Ring Signature (LwRS) Scheme, 
implementation of improved Dual-key Stealth Address Protocol for IoT (DkSAP-IoT) and Non-Interactive Zero-Knowledge 
Proofs (NIZKP) as a Decentralized Application (DApp) paving way for Privacy-preservation in Blockchain.
# Improvements.
The key image in LwRS is modified making is double-spending resisitant.
DkSAP-IoT is improved to include symmetric encryption and data storage on the decentralized platform IPFS/IPNS.
# Testing
The Smart Contract in use in this framework acts an aggregator of public keys and is tested for vulnerabilities using 
Oyente (an auto-auditing tool for Smart Contracts) and came out as secured. 
Tests shows that users incur cost (in terms of gas on Ethereum) of 214,731 which is far lower than existing
schemes.
# Requirements
Chrome browser with MetaMask extension installed.
